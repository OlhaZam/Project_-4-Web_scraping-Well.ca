# Project #4 

### Web_scraping of sales and offers from Well.ca (an online health and beauty store).

The dataset was created using web mining techniques, which involved scraping the Well.ca website to gather information about the products in 
the sale category. The dataset includes the product name, original price, and new price for each item.

The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the pricing strategies and promotional offers of Well.ca. 
By examining the prevalence of different discount ranges, we can understand which discount ranges are most frequently proposed by the store. 
This information can be valuable for both the store and customers in making informed purchasing decisions and understanding market 
trends in the health and beauty industry.
